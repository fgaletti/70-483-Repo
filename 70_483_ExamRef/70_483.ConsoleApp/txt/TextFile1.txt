GLOBAL ASSEMBLY CACHE

 -> Contains a centralizae coy of the .Net Framework
 -> you can put your assemblies 


 GAC -> Version at machine level

   -> gacutil /i myassembly.dll

      -> First step is to give a strong name

  UPDATE : same name/version
    -> -> gacutil /i myassembly.dll
	 

 *CHanging ASSEMBLY'S VERSION -> gives a Brand-new Identity

   SYDE-BY-SYDE -> prevents "Dll hell"
    
	-Writes Util assembly 1.0.0.0 -> install in the GAC 
	-2 new features -> 1.0.0.1 
    
	    -> you can choose what version to reference when compiling
		-> any application previosly compliled to reference Utils 1.0.0.0
		   will continue to do SO.
