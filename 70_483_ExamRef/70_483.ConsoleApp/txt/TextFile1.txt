	 public enum FileMode

	 Append -> Opens the file if it exists and seeks to the end of the file, or creates a new file. 
	          This requires Append permission. FileMode.Append can be used only in conjunction with FileAccess.Write. 

	Create -> Specifies that the operating system should create a new file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.
	         This requires Write permission
			  If the file already exists but is a hidden file, 
			  an UnauthorizedAccessException exception is thrown.
    
	CreateNew -> Specifies that the operating system should create a new file. This requires Write permission.
	              If the file already exists, an IOException exception is thrown.


	Open  -> open an existing file.  A FileNotFoundException exception is thrown if the file does not exist.

	OpenOrCreate -> the operating system should open a file if it exists; otherwise, a new file should be created. 
	   If the file is opened with FileAccess.Read, Read permission is required. If the file access is FileAccess.Write, Write permission is required.
	If the file is opened with FileAccess.ReadWrite, both Read and Write permissions are required.

	Truncate -> he operating system should open an existing file. When the file is opened, it should be truncated so that its size is zero bytes. 
	           This requires Write permission. 
			    Attempts to read from a file opened with FileMode.Truncate 
				cause an ArgumentException exception.


	*CONVERT TEXT RO BYNARY DATA WITH UNICODE

	 -> Stream Can only transfer Arrays of bytes to and from the storage device.

	 **UNICODE -> a mapping of characters symbols to numeric values.
	 
	 Encoding -> converts UNICODE TEXT into an array of bytes.
	 

	 WORK WITH TEXT FILES

	  -> STREAMWRITER -> extend TEXTWRITER

  -> PATHS -> -RELATIVE 
             -ABSOLUTE

       -> RELATIVE PATH : location that is relative to the FOLDER in which the PROGRAMM
	                      is presently RUNNING

	   -> ABSOLUTE :  


	   PERIODS : .

	      -> single . -> CUrrent Directory

		  -> double . -> means the Directory Above the present one.

		  *the path must "climb" up through four parents directories 

	 --
	  -> ABSOLUTE PATH -> includes the drive letter and indentifies all subdirectories
